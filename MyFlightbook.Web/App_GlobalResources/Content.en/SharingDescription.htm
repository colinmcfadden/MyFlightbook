<div>
    <p>If you share a link to this flight with someone, they will see high-level details of the flight including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Your name</li>
        <li>Date of flight</li>
        <li>Aircraft tail number</li>
        <li>Route of flight</li>
        <li>Your comments</li>
        <li>Any images or videos from the flight or aircraft</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Otherwise, even with the link, they will see nothing more than the route of flight - nothing to identify you.</p>
    <p>You can change this setting at any time.</p>

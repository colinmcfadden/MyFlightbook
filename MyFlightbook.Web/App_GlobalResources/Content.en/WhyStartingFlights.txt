<p>In a paper logbook, you can simply copy the ending totals from your old book into the first line of your new book and pick up from there.</p>
<p>That doesn't work so well, however, in the electronic environment, for two reasons:</p>
<ul>
	<li><span style="font-weight:bold">%APP_NAME% doesn't have a pre-defined set of totals</span>; all of the various categories of totals are generated dynamically based on the flying that you've done.  So the list of possible starting totals is quite literally infinite.</li>
	<li><span style="font-weight:bold">Paper has no concept of sub-totals.</span>  This leads to problems when doing totals based on search criteria.  For example, if you search for your year-to-date totals, should starting totals be included or not?</li>
</ul>
<p>For these reasons, %APP_NAME% lets you use one or more starting flights in various aircraft as a way of approximating your totals.</p>
<p>The aircraft you use for these flights - and the dates used for these flights - determines 
the nature of the totals (e.g., how much time is in helicopters, how much is in single-engine land planes, etc.).</p>
<p>And, because these are flights like any other in your logbook, they make sub-totals behave predictably and 
are also easy to edit (just like any other flight!) as necessary over time (for example, if you incrementally enter your older flights.)</p>
<p>Ultimately, though, starting flights are just an approximation - they yield rough edges depending on the sorts of searches you use for your totals.  
The only way to avoid any approximation is to enter all of your flights into the system.</p>

Dear {0}

You recently saved a flight on %APP_NAME% with a request to tweet it to your feed on Twitter.

Your flight was successfully saved, but it was not posted to Twitter because you have not yet authorized %APP_NAME% to post on your behalf to your Twitter feed.

To give %APP_NAME% the ability to post flights (only the ones you select) to your Twitter feed, please visit http://%APP_URL%%APP_ROOT%/Member/EditProfile.aspx and click on the "Preferences" section.

Doing this will enable you to choose whether or not to tweet a flight to your Twitter feed when you save it.

Thanks

--The %APP_NAME% Team

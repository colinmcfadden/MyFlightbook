Dear {0}

You have indicated on %APP_NAME% that you fly the aircraft with the tailnumber "{1}".

This aircraft had been identified as being this model:

     {2}

However, another pilot has just changed it to be this model:

     {3}

The change in model could affect your totals and your flying currency computations.

Often, this is a minor change, such as specifying a specific variant of a model.  E.g., changing a
Cessna 172 to be a Cessna 172-S.

Sometimes, aircraft identifiers are reused, and the change of model may be an indication of this.
If that is the case, please contact us (use the "Contact Us" link at http://%APP_URL%) and we can 
address this.

If you believe that this change was made in error, or if this could possibly be the
result of a tailnumber being re-assigned to a new aircraft, please contact us at 
http://%APP_URL%%APP_ROOT%/Public/ContactMe.aspx and we can help resolve this.

Thank-you,

The %APP_NAME% Team

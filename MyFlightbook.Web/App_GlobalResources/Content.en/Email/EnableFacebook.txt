Dear {0}

You recently saved a flight on %APP_NAME% with a request to post it to your account on Facebook.

Your flight was successfully saved, but it was not posted to Facebook because you have not yet authorized %APP_NAME% to post on your behalf to Facebook.

To give %APP_NAME% the ability to post flights (only the ones you select) to your Facebook profile, please visit http://%APP_URL%%APP_ROOT%/Member/EditProfile.aspx/pftPrefs.

Doing this will enable you to choose whether or not to post a flight to your Facebook account when you save it.

Thanks

--The %APP_NAME% Team

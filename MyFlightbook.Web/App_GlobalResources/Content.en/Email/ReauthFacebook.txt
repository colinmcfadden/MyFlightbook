Dear {0}

You recently saved a flight on %APP_NAME% with a request to post it to your account on Facebook.

Your flight was successfully saved, but your authorization for %APP_NAME% to post on your behalf to Facebook has expired or is no longer valid.

You can re-authorize %APP_NAME% by visiting http://%APP_URL%%APP_ROOT%/Member/EditProfile.aspx/pftPrefs.

Doing this will re-enable you to choose whether or not to post a flight to your Facebook account when you save it.

Thanks

--The %APP_NAME% Team

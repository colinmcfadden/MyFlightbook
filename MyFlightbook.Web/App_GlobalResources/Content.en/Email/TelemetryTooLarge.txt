Dear {0}

You recently added a flight on %APP_NAME% with the attached telemetry data which is too large for the system.

We saved the flight for you without the data, but didn't want you to lose any of your data, so we are including it with this message.

You can try again to attach it to your flight (you can do this from the website at http://%APP_URL%), but please reduce it to less than 300K before doing so. 

Thanks

--The %APP_NAME% Team

Dear {0}

You just created a new aircraft "{1}" on %APP_NAME%, and identified this aircraft with the following model:

     {2}

However, this aircraft was already identified by other pilots as being this model:

     {3}

Because this aircraft is already being used in flights by other pilots, %APP_NAME% assumes
the pre-existing model to be correct.
{4}

Sometimes, aircraft identifiers are reused, or the aircraft in the system is incorrect.  

If you believe that the model you specified is correct, you can update it (or choose the correct 
version) at http://%APP_URL%, under the "Aircraft" section. 

Please contact us at http://%APP_URL%%APP_ROOT%/Public/ContactMe.aspx if you need more assistance.

Thank-you,

The %APP_NAME% Team

				<b>NOTE:</b> You may be using "Anonymous" aircraft, which is used to log time in an aircraft (or a set of aircraft) of a specific model 
				but where you don't have the tail number(s) of the specific aircraft.  For example, you might use this if you are an airline pilot who flies a different
				737 every day.  You can find out the tailnumber that is used internally for anonymous aircraft that you have added to your account by 
				viewing details of the aircraft.  The tailnumber begins with a "#" followed by 6 numeric digits; e.g., "#123456".
